            <h3>Future Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p>I am an extravagant lady with a good eye for detail and thinking out of the box. I need to create and this is why programming fascinates me. In addition to it I love making my own clothes and jewelry or trying different hair styles. I also like cooking and painting. </p>
            <p>Once I tried to write a code and since then I know this is exactly for me because coding connects creativity with problem solving. I want to learn as much as possible. I am at the beginning of this adventurous journey and I am really excited about it.  </p>
